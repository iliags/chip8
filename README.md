# Chip 8

A Chip-8 emulator for practice.

## History

I started writing this using Rust with egui to get familiar with Rust and its ecosystem. During development, I realized that some of the things I wanted to do (aside from pure emulation) required recreating work done in existing game engines. I switched to Unreal Engine as it provides most of the additional frameworks necessary for these features.

## Future

I'm working on this in my spare time, so I don't have a set roadmap of features to add.
