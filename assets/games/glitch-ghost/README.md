## controls

e - advance the title screen

from you. you can move while the person is running

w,a,s,d - move up, left, down, and right respectively


## goal

each screen of the cemetery has a unique layout of tombstones. you'll
need to figure out how to get each person to run into their own graves.
once scared, each person will run away from glitch ghost and turn right
whenever they encounter an obstacle, be it a grave, the fence, or even
glitch ghost themselves!  only one person will enter the cemetery at a
time, and they'll always come in through the front gate.
